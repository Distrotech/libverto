This is particularly true of libraries who want to be useful to many\r\napplications who use loops that do not integrate with one another or which\r\nuse home-grown loops. libverto provides a loop-neutral async api which allows\r\nthe library to expose asynchronous interfaces and offload the choice of the\r\nmain loop to the application.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
